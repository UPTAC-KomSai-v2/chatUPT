## ChatUPT Files:

   - **On Windows**: Shift + Right-click the folder and choose "Open PowerShell/Command Window Here."
   - **On Linux/Mac**: Use `cd` to navigate to the folder.

3. Run the following command: `java -jar ChatUPT-Server.jar`
4. Wait for the message:  Server started on port 12345...

## Step 2: Start the Application

## Troubleshooting

### Server Doesnâ€™t Start:
- Ensure Java is installed.
- Check if another application is using port `12345`: `netstat -an | find "12345"`
- If port is in use, restart your computer or configure the server to use a different port.

### Application Doesnâ€™t Launch:
- Ensure `ChatUPT-App.jar` is in the same folder as required resources (e.g., images/).
- Check the terminal for errors and report them.

### Login Fails:
- Ensure the server is running.
- Verify the server is reachable on `localhost:12345`.
